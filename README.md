# Track your peas...

Like a lot of people, I use VS Code. I spend a lot of term there, and after a while you like to set things up the way you like them. I have for some time wanted to track the time I spend, mostly to prove that I am providing value to the people I work for, but also to see for my self when I work, for how long, that kind of thing. And I have two machines and alternate between them so need something that tracks activity across all instances.

So track my peas is a personal tool to track my work. There are plenty of trackers out there but they either sit only on the local machine or you need to get an API key and pay a subscription. That is way overkill for me, and I don't want to pay for stuff like this. 

## Features

Track your peas is a simple time tracker, with a start/stop/pause toggle that sits unobtrusively in your activity bar at the bottom. It stores the times in a Gist, so you will need a personal access token to make it work, and have access t'internet (obvs). If you don't want people to see what you are doing, you will need a private Gist I guess.

<!-- For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\) -->

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
